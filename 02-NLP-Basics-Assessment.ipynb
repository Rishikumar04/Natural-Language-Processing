       "his back, the wrists bound with a cord.  A rope closely encircled his\n",
       "neck.  It was attached to a stout cross-timber above his head and the\n",
       "slack fell to the level of his knees.  Some loose boards laid upon the\n",
       "ties supporting the rails of the railway supplied a footing for him\n",
       "and his executioners--two private soldiers of the Federal army,\n",
       "directed by a sergeant who in civil life may have been a deputy\n",
       "sheriff.  At a short remove upon the same temporary platform was an\n",
       "officer in the uniform of his rank, armed.  He was a captain.  A\n",
       "sentinel at each end of the bridge stood with his rifle in the\n",
       "position known as \"support,\" that is to say, vertical in front of the\n",
       "left shoulder, the hammer resting on the forearm thrown straight\n",
       "across the chest--a formal and unnatural position, enforcing an erect\n",
       "carriage of the body.  It did not appear to be the duty of these two\n",
       "men to know what was occurring at the center of the bridge; they\n",
       "merely blockaded the two ends of the foot planking that traversed it.\n",
       "\n",
       "Beyond one of the sentinels nobody was in sight; the railroad ran\n",
       "straight away into a forest for a hundred yards, then, curving, was\n",
       "lost to view.  Doubtless there was an outpost farther along.  The\n",

       "\"parade rest,\" the butts of their rifles on the ground, the barrels\n",
       "inclining slightly backward against the right shoulder, the hands\n",
       "crossed upon the stock. A lieutenant stood at the right of the line,\n",

       "right.  Excepting the group of four at the center of the bridge, not a\n",
       "man moved.  The company faced the bridge, staring stonily, motionless.\n",
       "The sentinels, facing the banks of the stream, might have been statues\n",

       "observing the work of his subordinates, but making no sign. Death is a\n",
       "dignitary who when he comes announced is to be received with formal\n",
       "manifestations of respect, even by those most familiar with him.  In\n",

       "straight nose, firm mouth, broad forehead, from which his long, dark\n",
       "hair was combed straight back, falling behind his ears to the collar\n",
       "of his well fitting frock coat.  He wore a moustache and pointed\n",
       "beard, but no whiskers; his eyes were large and dark gray, and had a\n",
       "kindly expression which one would hardly have expected in one whose\n",
       "neck was in the hemp.  Evidently this was no vulgar assassin.  The\n",
       "liberal military code makes provision for hanging many kinds of\n",
       "persons, and gentlemen are not excluded.\n",
       "\n",
       "The preparations being complete, the two private soldiers stepped\n",

       "of the bridge.  The end upon which the civilian stood almost, but not\n",
       "quite, reached a fourth.  This plank had been held in place by the\n",
       "weight of the captain; it was now held by that of the sergeant.  At a\n",
       "signal from the former the latter would step aside, the plank would\n",
       "tilt and the condemned man go down between two ties.  The arrangement\n",
       "commended itself to his judgement as simple and effective.  His face\n",
       "had not been covered nor his eyes bandaged.  He looked a moment at his\n",
       "\"unsteadfast footing,\" then let his gaze wander to the swirling water\n",
       "of the stream racing madly beneath his feet. A piece of dancing\n",
       "driftwood caught his attention and his eyes followed it down the\n",
       "current.  How slowly it appeared to move!  What a sluggish stream!\n",
       "\n",
       "He closed his eyes in order to fix his last thoughts upon his wife and\n",

       "mists under the banks at some distance down the stream, the fort, the\n",
       "soldiers, the piece of drift--all had distracted him.  And now he\n",
       "became conscious of a new disturbance.  Striking through the thought\n",
       "of his dear ones was sound which he could neither ignore nor\n",
       "understand, a sharp, distinct, metallic percussion like the stroke of\n",
       "a blacksmith's hammer upon the anvil; it had the same ringing quality.\n",
       "He wondered what it was, and whether immeasurably distant or near by--\n",
       "it seemed both.  Its recurrence was regular, but as slow as the\n",
       "tolling of a death knell.  He awaited each new stroke with impatience\n",
       "and--he knew not why--apprehension.  The intervals of silence grew\n",
       "progressively longer; the delays became maddening.  With their greater\n",
       "infrequency the sounds increased in strength and sharpness.  They hurt\n",
       "his ear like the thrust of a knife; he feared he would shriek.  What he\n",
       "heard was the ticking of his watch.\n",
       "\n",
       "He unclosed his eyes and saw again the water below him.  \"If I could\n",
       "free my hands,\" he thought, \"I might throw off the noose and spring\n",
       "into the stream.  By diving I could evade the bullets and, swimming\n",

       "owners a politician, he was naturally an original secessionist and\n",
       "ardently devoted to the Southern cause.  Circumstances of an imperious\n",
       "nature, which it is unnecessary to relate here, had prevented him from\n",

       "inglorious restraint, longing for the release of his energies, the\n",

       "\"The Yanks are repairing the railroads,\" said the man, \"and are\n",

       "tunnels, or trains will be summarily hanged.  I saw the order.\"\n",
       "\n",

       "pressure upon his throat, followed by a sense of suffocation.  Keen,\n",
       "poignant agonies seemed to shoot from his neck downward through every\n",
       "fiber of his body and limbs.  These pains appeared to flash along well\n",
       "defined lines of ramification and to beat with an inconceivably rapid\n",
       "periodicity.  They seemed like streams of pulsating fire heating him\n",
       "to an intolerable temperature.  As to his head, he was conscious of\n",
       "nothing but a feeling of fullness--of congestion.  These sensations\n",
       "were unaccompanied by thought.  The intellectual part of his nature\n",
       "was already effaced; he had power only to feel, and feeling was\n",
       "torment.  He was conscious of motion. Encompassed in a luminous cloud,\n",
       "of which he was now merely the fiery heart, without material\n",
       "substance, he swung through unthinkable arcs of oscillation, like a\n",
       "vast pendulum.  Then all at once, with terrible suddenness, the light\n",
       "about him shot upward with the noise of a loud splash; a frightful\n",
       "roaring was in his ears, and all was cold and dark.  The power of\n",
       "thought was restored; he knew that the rope had broken and he had\n",
       "fallen into the stream.  There was no additional strangulation; the\n",
       "noose about his neck was already suffocating him and kept the water\n",
       "from his lungs.  To die of hanging at the bottom of a river!--the idea\n",
       "seemed to him ludicrous.  He opened his eyes in the darkness and saw\n",
       "above him a gleam of light, but how distant, how inaccessible!  He was\n",
       "still sinking, for the light became fainter and fainter until it was a\n",
       "mere glimmer.  Then it began to grow and brighten, and he knew that he\n",
       "was rising toward the surface--knew it with reluctance, for he was now\n",
       "very comfortable.  \"To be hanged and drowned,\" he thought, \"that is\n",
       "not so bad; but I do not wish to be shot.  No; I will not be shot;\n",
       "that is not fair.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "He was not conscious of an effort, but a sharp pain in his wrist\n",
       "apprised him that he was trying to free his hands.  He gave the\n",
       "struggle his attention, as an idler might observe the feat of a\n",
       "juggler, without interest in the outcome.  What splendid effort!--what\n",
       "magnificent, what superhuman strength!  Ah, that was a fine endeavor!\n",
       "Bravo!  The cord fell away; his arms parted and floated upward, the\n",
       "hands dimly seen on each side in the growing light.  He watched them\n",
       "with a new interest as first one and then the other pounced upon the\n",
       "noose at his neck.  They tore it away and thrust it fiercely aside,\n",
       "its undulations resembling those of a water snake.  \"Put it back, put\n",
       "it back!\"  He thought he shouted these words to his hands, for the\n",
       "undoing of the noose had been succeeded by the direst pang that he had\n",
       "yet experienced.  His neck ached horribly; his brain was on fire, his\n",

       "with an insupportable anguish! But his disobedient hands gave no heed\n",
       "to the command.  They beat the water vigorously with quick, downward\n",
       "strokes, forcing him to the surface.  He felt his head emerge; his\n",
       "eyes were blinded by the sunlight; his chest expanded convulsively,\n",

       "disturbance of his organic system had so exalted and refined them that\n",
       "they made record of things never before perceived.  He felt the\n",
       "ripples upon his face and heard their separate sounds as they struck.\n",
       "He looked at the forest on the bank of the stream, saw the individual\n",

       "insects upon them:  the locusts, the brilliant bodied flies, the gray\n",
       "spiders stretching their webs from twig to twig.  He noted the\n",
       "prismatic colors in all the dewdrops upon a million blades of grass.\n",
       "The humming of the gnats that danced above the eddies of the stream,\n",
       "the beating of the dragon flies' wings, the strokes of the water\n",
       "spiders' legs, like oars which had lifted their boat--all these made\n",
       "audible music.  A fish slid along beneath his eyes and he heard the\n",
       "rush of its body parting the water.\n",
       "\n",
       "He had come to the surface facing down the stream; in a moment the\n",
       "visible world seemed to wheel slowly round, himself the pivotal point,\n",
       "and he saw the bridge, the fort, the soldiers upon the bridge, the\n",
       "captain, the sergeant, the two privates, his executioners.  They were\n",
       "in silhouette against the blue sky.  They shouted and gesticulated,\n",
       "pointing at him.  The captain had drawn his pistol, but did not fire;\n",
       "the others were unarmed.  Their movements were grotesque and horrible,\n",
       "their forms gigantic.\n",
       "\n",
       "Suddenly he heard a sharp report and something struck the water\n",
       "smartly within a few inches of his head, spattering his face with\n",
       "spray.  He heard a second report, and saw one of the sentinels with\n",
       "his rifle at his shoulder, a light cloud of blue smoke rising from the\n",
       "muzzle.  The man in the water saw the eye of the man on the bridge\n",
       "gazing into his own through the sights of the rifle.  He observed that\n",
       "it was a gray eye and remembered having read that gray eyes were\n",
       "keenest, and that all famous marksmen had them. Nevertheless, this one\n",
       "had missed.\n",
       "\n",
       "A counter-swirl had caught Farquhar and turned him half round; he was\n",

       "of a clear, high voice in a monotonous singsong now rang out behind\n",
       "him and came across the water with a distinctness that pierced and\n",
       "subdued all other sounds, even the beating of the ripples in his ears.\n",
       "Although no soldier, he had frequented camps enough to know the dread\n",
       "significance of that deliberate, drawling, aspirated chant; the\n",
